    - The documentation categorizes functions based on their use cases, such as:

o Containers (e.g., std::vector, std::map)
o Algorithms (e.g., std::sort, std::find_if)
o I/O Operations (e.g., std::cin, std::ofstream)

- This categorization allows developers to quickly identify functions relevant to
    their needs.
**2. Offers Detailed Function Descriptions**
- Each function entry includes:
o **Syntax and parameters** (e.g., std::sort requires iterators)
o **Return type** (e.g., std::find returns an iterator)
o **Time complexity** (e.g., std::sort runs in O(n log n) on average)
- This helps developers choose efficient functions based on performance
requirements.
**3. Shows Example Usage**
- Official documentation often provides **code snippets** demonstrating correct
usage.
- Example from cppreference.com:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> nums = {4, 2, 8, 6};
  std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
  for (int n : nums) std::cout << n << " "; // Output: 2 4 6 8
}
```
- This helps developers understand function behavior in real-world scenarios.
**4. Highlights Compatibility and Constraints**
- Documentation clarifies:

o **Which headers to include** (e.g., <algorithm> for sorting functions)
o Which C++ versions support the function (e.g., std::filesystem was
introduced in C++17)
o Limitations (e.g., std::vector::reserve() does not change the size of the
container)

**5. Facilitates Efficient Debugging and Optimization**
    - Developers can use documentation to:
       o Compare **alternative functions** (e.g., std::stable_sort vs. std::sort)
       o Understand **exception handling behavior** (e.g., std::vector::at() throws
          an exception on out-of-range access, while operator[] does not)
**6. Easy Navigation Through Online Resources**
    - Key sources for C++ Standard Library documentation:
       o **cppreference.com** – Comprehensive and technical
       o **cplusplus.com** – Beginner-friendly explanations

**Aptitude Questions**

**1. Transaction Charge Calculation**

**Question:**
A customer has initiated a transaction of 5000. The charge rate is 10% set. How much
charge will the customer pay additionally including the transaction amount?

**Answer Choices:**

- a) 500
- b) 5500
- c) 4500
- d) None of above

**Your Answer:**

- **Transaction amount** = 5000
- **Charge rate** = 10% of 5000
    5000×0.10=
- **Total amount to be paid** = Transaction amount + Charge
    5000+500=

Thus, the customer will pay **5500 in total**.

**2. Web Transaction Users**

**Question:**
Wowpe has 10,000 users, and 20% of them do the transaction from web every day. How
many users do transactions from web daily?


**Answer Choices:**

- a) 5000
- b) 2000
- c) 2500
- d) 1000

**Your Answer:**

- **Total users** = 10,
- **Percentage of users transacting from the web daily** = 20%
    10,000×0.20=

Thus, **2,000 users** perform transactions from the web daily.

**3. Support Ticket Resolution**

**Question:**
If an issue resolution takes an average of 25 minutes, and you receive 6 support tickets
in one hour, how many tickets can you resolve in 2 hours?

**Answer Choices:**

- a) 5
- b) 6
- c) 4
- d) 12

**Your Answer:**

- **Time taken to resolve one ticket** = 25 minutes
- **Total available time** = 2 hours = **120 minutes**
- **Tickets resolved in 2 hours** :
    120 /25=4.8≈4 (full tickets)

However, since the **question states that 6 tickets are received per hour** , it implies a
continuous flow of tickets.

- **If each agent can work in parallel** , a team could still handle **6 tickets in 2 hours**
    if managed efficiently.


Thus, the best answer is **B) 6**.

**4. Platform Performance Troubleshooting**

**Question:**
You are part of a team responsible for maintaining the Wowpe platform. During a busy
transaction period, the system starts slowing down. Which of the following actions
would be the best to ensure the platform runs smoothly?

**Answer Choices:**

- a) Stop users to use the platform during slowing down.
- b) Disable the payment feature temporarily.
- c) Highlighting slowness to product team.
- d) Highlighting slowness to bank.

**Answer: Highlighting slowness to the product team**

**Reasoning:**

- The **product team** is responsible for system performance and scalability. They
    can analyze the issue and **implement optimizations** to handle the increased
    load.
- **Stopping users from using the platform (Option A)** is a poor approach, as it will
    frustrate customers and cause revenue loss.
- **Disabling payments (Option B)** may prevent further transactions but doesn’t
    solve the root cause and affects business operations.
- **Highlighting the issue to the bank (Option D)** is only relevant if the problem is
    on the bank’s end, which isn't confirmed.

Thus, the best action is **to notify the product team** so they can investigate and resolve
the issue efficiently.
